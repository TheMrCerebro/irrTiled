# irrTiled
Load TMX files created with Tiled into the Irrlicht3D Engine. 

With few lines of code you can show complex maps or if you prefer use all the variables to create complex things. Also, by using part of the Irrlicht 3D Engine, it can also be used to create 3D environments using boxes and loading meshes.

Examples:

<b>2DBasic</b> - It contains a very basic example of how a TMX file is loaded and how the data is used
to draw a map with all its layers and tilesets.

<b>3DBasic</b> - It contains an example of how to use the 3d functions of Irrlicht Engine to generate a 3D
environment with the map data.

<b>Animation</b> - It is a simple example of how you can create animations with tiles, as well as how the
tileset is used externally (TSX files). It can be done in many ways.

<b>Levels</b> - It shows a way to create different heights in 3D environments. I use positive and negative
signs to know if one layer is above another or below.

<b>Objects</b> - It shows how the data of objectgroup and object is used to use them in anything. They
are very useful since they can be added to the player, enemies, create collisions or damage zones.
<b>Properties</b> - This example shows how to extract the properties of the objects. Properties can be
present in "layers", "tileset" and many others. They contain information added by the user.

<b>Shapes</b> - The objects can have many shapes to be used on the map. The most common is the
rectangle but you can use others such as ellipses, points or even create polygons. In this example I
visually show what shapes it has and how they could be used.

<b>Tilesets</b> - This example shows how several different tileset can be used on the same map to add
more images, effects or animations.

Too easy!
